# Bio
Software Engineer. Mentor. Lecturer.

Used to work on UI stuff with JavaScript, TypeScript, and NodeJS.
Have experience in the backend (PHP, NodeJS) and mobile (C#, React Native) development.
Have worked with most of the modern UI frameworks (React, Angular, Vue),
and also with older ones like AngularJS, Backbone/Marionette,
and ExtJS too.
In recent years had some experience with the backend - have been developing microservices with NestJS, Postgres, Kafka streams, also GraphQL services with usage of Apollo, and Apollo Federation (v2).

Passionate about React tech stack, and prefer to work with it. I prefer to use TypeScript over JavaScript as it seems to be safer. For a long time used to work with Redux as state management (with different middlewares). But like an idea of client libraries with cache (Apollo Client, React Query, ...),
and also an idea of fine-grained atomic reactive state (SolidJS).

Conduct courses/lectures for students.
